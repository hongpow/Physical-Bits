# Physical Bits (Project 3)
Our third and last project was about Physical Bits. We had to think about binary conditions around us and find ways to make them comprehensible/visible to us with the help of a flip-dot and an arduino board.

## Peek-a-Boo

_This little guy here playfully shows you whether something blocks his view or not. Play with him peek-a-boo and see how surprised he'll be when you put your hand or something in front of his view._

An ultrasonic sensor was used to determine whether something was in front of our object or not. The end result was a cute little head with the flip-dot as his mouth with two options: smile or mouth-opened. The sensors were used as his eyes.
If someone now blocks his view with hands or something different, he will then open his mouth making a surprised expression.
