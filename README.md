# Physical Bits (Project 3)
Our third and last project was about Physical Bits. We had to think about binary conditions around us and find ways to make them comprehensible/visible to us with the help of a flip-dot and an arduino board.

## Peek-a-Boo

An ultrasonic sensor was used to determine whether something was in front of our object or not.
